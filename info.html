    Hello! The name's Marek.
</p>
<p>
    I like many things.
</p>
<p>
    I like flailing wildly to rhythmic music in absolute euphoria. 
    I like being still, feeling the weight of the universe pouring out of abstract sound. 
    I like peering into utter humanity radiating through edited film. 
    I like to learn, I like to comprehend, I like to eat up information and spit it back out again.
</p>
<p>
    I appreciate compassion, creativity, clarity, curiousity, confidence, and courage. 
    I appreciate artists of all disciplines. 
    I <b>don't</b> like or appreciate oppressive and abusive power structures.
</p>
<p>
    I am a software developer by trade, but I also am a musician, artist, writer, improviser, and poetic human being. 
    I have goals and aspirations, but also take things day by day and just try things that inspire me. 
    Overall, I'm just trying to live the best life that I can.
</p>
