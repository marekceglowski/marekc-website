    Hello! I'm Marek.
</p>
<p>
    I like to learn, I like to comprehend, I like to eat up information and spit it back out again. 
    I like moving my body to rhythmic music in states of pure joy and freedom. 
    I like being still, feeling the weight of the universe pouring out of abstract sound. 
    I like peering into utter humanity on screens and physical materials.
    I like creating stuff. I like to be in awe of created stuff. 
</p>
<p>
    I appreciate compassion, creativity, clarity, curiousity, confidence, and courage. 
    I appreciate crafters, soundmakers, wordsmiths, and artists of all disciplines. 
    I appreciate every bit of effort made towards dismantling oppressive and abusive power structures. 
    I appreciate the folks that empathize and humanize.
</p>
<p>
    I am a software developer by trade, but I also am a musician, artist, writer, improviser, and body made of meat, poetry, and stardust. 
    I have goals and aspirations, but also follow inspirations as they come and go through each moment.
